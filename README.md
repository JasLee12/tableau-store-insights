# A commercial insights report using store data
This project uses tableau to analyse the store dataset, aiming to provide insights for strategic refinement. It offers a comprehensive analysis of the following: Sales, Product Category, Market, Customer Segmentation and Shipping Costs to advocate for dynamic approaches aligned with seasonality trends to enhance overall profitability. This description will incorporate sections from the project report, also written by me as part of the project.

## Context
All analyses will use yearly quarters, where applicable. Monetary values are represented in millions (M) or thousands (K) of British Pounds. There will be speculation and assumptions made due to the lack of background information.

## Objectives & Methodology
The analyses conducted aim to ascertain the following key insights:
1. Sales analysis
   - Performance and growth
   - Time trends and seasonality
2. Segment analysis
   - Product category, market and customer
3. KPIs
   - Profit-sales ratio
   - Quantity-sales ratio
4. Shipping costs
   - Optimise shipping strategies and cost controls
   - Enhance overall shipping efficiency
5. Forecast

## Recommendations
Sales strategies should to be reassessed and enhanced for sustained growth and profitability. From the low profit-sales ratio, a review of current sales approaches, pricing models and operational costs is necessary. To address this, a shift towards optimising product pricing and streamlining operational efficiencies could be explored. Geographic mapping reveals market dynamics across regions, offering opportunities for targeted marketing. Additionally, quantity-sales ratio by segments could guide more focused and effective marketing efforts.
Leveraging seasonality trends can ensure a more responsive and dynamic sales approach. Insights from shipping cost analysis could aid in dynamic logistics planning and resource allocation based on demand fluctuations. By delving into the total cost of shipping modes, opportunities arise to negotiate better contracts to optimise shipping routes and capitalise on economies of scale.

## Conclusion
To conclude, the analysis of store data highlights the need for strategic refinement within the business. With a profit-sales ratio of 11.61%, it is essential to reassess current strategies and operational efficiency. The detailed examination of shipping costs invites a closer look at shipping optimisation, while incorporating seasonality insights can help adapt sales and shipping strategies during peak demand periods. This analysis serves as a catalyst to align sales and shipping strategies, ensuring cost-effectiveness without compromising service or quality and aims to enhance overall operational efficiency in the dynamic landscape of a global marketplace.
